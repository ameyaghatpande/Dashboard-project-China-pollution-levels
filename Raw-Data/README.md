This folder contains the raw data required for the visualization project
It contains data from multiple sources as follows

-StateAir U.S. Department of State Air Quality Monitoring Program. These are the PM2.5 data collected from 5 major Chinese cities (Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenyang). The measurements in this dataset include the hourly value of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that have a diameter less than 2.5 micrometers which is commonly considered as the air quality index.
-China Total Production of Energy and Its Composition in 2016. The data is provided by the National Bureau of Statistics of China. The Bureau publishes statistical yearbook which has data in various divisions such as population, energy consumption/production, and Public Health and Social Services data.
-CO2 emissions (metric tons per capita) by The World Bank. The dataset provides per capita CO2 emissions for various countries from 1960 to 2013.
-Forest area (% of land area) by The World Bank. The dataset provides forest area coverage for various countries from 1990 to 2015. The reason we included the dataset is to because to increase forest area coverage is one of the improvements proposed by the Chinese government in its Paris Commitment submission.
-Air Pollution by Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser from Our World in Data. This completed report included many pollution indexes. We gathered SO2 and PM2.5 emission data per capita (tonnes per year) for the U.S. and China.
-Volume of sulfur dioxide emissions in the U.S. from 1970 to 2014 (in 1,000 tons) by Statista. The dataset included the overall SO2 emission in the U.S. from 1970 to 2014.
-Sulphur dioxide emissions in China from 2005 to 2015 (in 1,000 tons) by Statista. The dataset included the overall SO2 emission in China from 2005 to 2015.
-Volume of particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions in the U.S. from 1990 to 2014 (in 1,000 tons) by Statista. The dataset included the PM2.5 (an important air quality index) emission in the U.S. from 1990 to 2014.
